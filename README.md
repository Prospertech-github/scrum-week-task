# Getting Started with Project

This project is titled `Moments`. This web app was developed in order to let its users `share their moments`. It is indeed similar to `Instagram`.

`N.B:: This project at the time of push is incomplete and can be revisited. It was a task issued while learning Agile Software development. Also note that, this project was a team task and hence, this repository just contains my contribution to the development of the app.`

## File Structure
The project has 3 folders. These 3 folders are: `public`, `src` and the `node modules` folders.

### Node Modules folder
This folder contains all dependencies for the smooth development of the React project. It also contains the font awesome dependecy too.

### Public folder
This folder contains the `index.html` file, the `favicon`. This is where the project is being rendered from.

### Src folder
This folder is populated with various files and folders from which the app is built from. The `src` folder contains the `components folder`, the `asset folder`, the App.js file, the index.css file and the index.js file too.

#### Asset folder
This folder contains 2 folders, namely: `Image folder` and the `Fonts folder`. The `Image folder` contains all the images used in the development of the app.

### Component folder
The component folder contains the two folders. These folders are: `SignUpContainer` folder and `LoginContainer` folder.
#### SignUpContainer folder
This folder contains all the components used in the development of the `Sign up` page of the app both in desktop view. Every component is structured as a folder that contains its `.js file` and its `.css file` too.
#### LoginContainer folder
This folder contains every component used in development of the `Login` page of the app. Every component is structured as a folder that contains its `.js file` and its `.css file` too.
